# Pac-Man UofT edition
Little Pac-Man-like game I made in one week for a school assignment.

It's not perfect - I cut some corners to make it work - but I'm still proud for 1 week of work.

# Play the game
Compiled binaries for Windows, Mac and Linux are in compiled_binaries/.
Linux binaries are untested.

# Edit or compile the game
Open the repo with unity, then go to scenes/ and select main.
